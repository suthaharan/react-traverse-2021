### Notes
- ReactJS is a library for building interfaces.
- Gives you a structure for the view layer
- React is the V in the MVC
- JSX - Dynamic markup
- Interactive UI's with Virtual DOM
- Performance and testing
- Good handle on data types, variables, functions, loops, promises, async programming, array methods like forEach() & map(), fetch API and making HTTP requests

#### Difference between class and function component styles
```
export const Header = () => {
    return (
        <div>
          <h1>Sample Header</h1>
        </div>  
    )
}

export default class Header extends React.Component {
    render(){
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Sample Class Header</h1>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

#### Components and State
* Components can be classes or functions
* Components can take in "props" which are attributes
```
<Header title="Sample title">
```
* Components can have states which is an object that determines how a component renders and behaves
* "App" or "global" state refers to a state that is available to the entire UI and not just to a single component
* Prior to react 16.8 we had to use class based components to use state. Now, we use functional components with hooks
* React hooks are functions that let us hook into React state and lifecycle features from function components
* * useState - Returns a stateful value and a function to update it
* * useEffect - Perform side effects in function components 
* There are some naming conventions that you need to be aware of when writing attributes to JSX elements such as "className" for "class", "htmlFor" for "for" etc.
* If you do not want to have a grouping of elements inside div for JSX element, you can just use fragment or empty angle brackets as in <> ... </>

#### Starting a react project
```
$ node -v
$ npm -v (make sure it is greater than 5.x to use npx)
$ npx create-react-app task-tracker
$ cd task-tracker
$ npm start
```
* Chrome extension: React developer tools is a recommendation to view the states/components/props and other variables. If you run the application from the build folder, react dev tools would indicate that you are running the production build
* If Emmet doesn't work, go to the bottom of vscode editor and change javascript to javascript react
* In vscode, search for and setup ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets plugin. It has a bunch of snippets/components which makes it a quick start. For e.g. rafce
```
rafce (component)
impt (to import prop types)
rfce

```

* Flow of ReactJS app
-- public/index.html
---- src/index.js (has reference to root app component which gets replaced)
----


* Writing the app.js in function and class style
```javascript

// Function style
import Header from './components/Header'

const App = () => {
  const appTitle = "My Tasker!";
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <Header />
     <h1>{appTitle}</h1>
     <h1>Welcome to ReactJS Beginner!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;


// Class style
import React from 'react'
import Header from './components/Header'
class App extends React.component{
  render(){
    const appTitle = "My Tasker!";
    return (
      <div className="container">
        <Header />
      <h1>{appTitle}</h1>
      <h1>Welcome to ReactJS Beginner!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

###### Props, defaultProps and PropTypes
* You can pass props to components. Props are nothing but attributes that are set to elements. You can also defined default prop values.
```javascript
const Header = (props) => {
    return (
        <header>
        <h2>Hello {props.title}</h2>
        </header>
    )
}

Header.defaultProps = {
    title: "Track Tasks!"
}

export default Header
```

* Prop Types is something similar to setting property types. It makes your code robust.
```javascript
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

const Header = (props) => {
    return (
        <header>
        <h2>Hello {props.title}</h2>
        </header>
    )
}

Header.defaultProps = {
    title: "Track Tasks!"
}

Header.propTypes = {
    title: PropTypes.string,
}

export default Header
```

##### Styling in Components
* CSS within react can be done using stylesheets or using style components or by using direct css inline within components
* For inline CSS, you will use {{ color: 'red', backgroundColor:'black'}}
* Notice the above line to see how the CSS property names exclude usage of hyphens and instead use camel casing for naming inside react
* Or use a variable in the component with the above values and use a single curly braces and have this variable called in the relevant place
```javascript
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

const Button = ({color, text}) => {
    return <button style={{backgroundColor: color}} className='btn'>{text}</button>
}

Button.defaultProps = {
    text: "Add",
    color: "steelBlue"
}

Button.propTypes = {
    text: PropTypes.string,
    color: PropTypes.string
}
export default Button

```

* Simple component using map to parse through an array
```javascript
const tasks = [
    {
        id: 1,
        text: 'Doctor Appointment',
        day: 'Jan 1st at 1:40am',
        reminder: true
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        text: 'Meeting at School',
        day: 'Mar 1st at 2:40pm',
        reminder: true
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        text: 'Grocery Shopping',
        day: 'Apr 1st at 5:40pm',
        reminder: false
    }
]

const Tasks = () => {
    return (
        <>
          {tasks.map((t) => (
              <h3 key={t.id}>{t.text}</h3>
          ))}  
        </>
    )
}

export default Tasks
```
